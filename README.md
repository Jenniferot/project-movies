# Project Movies

I built a multi-page React application that shows the most popular movies in the US. 

## The problem

I started by skissing of how many pages I wanted to display and which components to use. Then I used postman to check out the api and how the information was set up. I worked in React and used useState, useEffects, Route, Switch and BrowserRouter to enable the functionality in this project.

If I had more time, I would have made a nav bar and bring in more info from different endpoints in the api.
